*(Working mockup)*

### Overview:

"Snake vs Mongoose" is a basic client-side Javascript "snake" game with a twist: a previous player's data will be stored and loaded each time you play the game. This *asynchronous multiplayer* element creates the illusion of real time multiplayer.

The gameplay is described in more detail in the [user stories](https://trello.com/b/5zyFGe0u/snake-vs-mongoose) document.

The purpose of this project is to familiarize myself with MongoDB, Express, Mongoose, and Node. I'm also intending to create a polished final project that will look good in my portfolio. I'm also hoping it will give me an oppurtunity to show off both my design and development skills within a short play session.
